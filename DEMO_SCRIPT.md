## 🎬 0:00 - 0:45 | The Problem (The "Why")
**[Visual: Stock footage of stressed office workers, late-night coding, or a calendar full of meetings. Fade to black with text: "Burnout is Systemic."]**

**Narrator**: "In the high-stakes world of software engineering, burnout doesn't happen overnight. It's a slow burn. Engineers drowning in context switching. Product Managers misaligned on priorities. Designers feeling disconnected from the roadmap. By the time a quarterly survey asks 'How are you feeling?', it's already too late. Good people have already mentally checked out."

**[Visual: Graphic showing a "Lag Indicator" survey vs. a "Leading Indicator" pulse.]**

**Narrator**: "We asked ourselves: What if we could detect the signals of burnout *before* they become a crisis? What if we could predict team fatigue 24 hours in advance?"

## 🚀 0:45 - 1:15 | Introducing WellLoop AI
**[Visual: WellLoop AI Logo animation, transitioning to the main Dashboard showing a healthy team status.]**

**Narrator**: "Introducing **WellLoop AI**. WellLoop isn't just another survey tool. It's an intelligent organizational psychology platform that listens to the *heartbeat* of your engineering team."

**[Visual: Screen recording of the 'Role-Adaptive Surveys'. Mouse clicking 'Engineer' and seeing specific code-related questions.]**

**Narrator**: "It starts with Role-Adaptive insights. WellLoop knows that an Engineer's blockers are different from a Designer's. Our surveys adapt dynamically, gathering high-signal data without the survey fatigue."

## 🧠 1:15 - 2:15 | Under the Hood (The Tech)
**[Visual: Architecture Diagram. Next.js logo on the left, Python/Gemini logo on the right. Arrows showing data flow.]**

**Narrator**: "But the real magic happens under the hood. We built a hybrid architecture to solve this. On the frontend, we use **Next.js 14** for a lightning-fast Edge experience. But to truly understand team sentiment, we needed more power."

**[Visual: Split screen. Code snippet of `context_engine.py` on one side, and a visualization of vectors connecting dots on the other.]**

**Narrator**: "We integrated a custom **Python RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Engine** powered by Google’s **Gemini 2.5 Flash**. We don't just look for keywords. We use **Vector Embeddings** to understand *semantic meaning*."

**[Visual: Animated formula of Cosine Similarity or a graph showing "Fatigue" clustering with "Sprint Velocity".]**

**Narrator**: "Using Cosine Similarity logic, the system mathematically links a current blocker—like 'too many meetings'—with historical patterns of attrition. It essentially treats 'burnout' as a solvable engineering problem."

## 💻 2:15 - 3:15 | Live Demo
**[Visual: Live screen recording. User typing "Why is the engineering team slowed down?" into the dashboard.]**

**Narrator**: "Let's see it in action. Here on the Predictive Dashboard, a manager asks: *'Why is velocity dropping?'*"

**[Visual: The AI 'Processing' animation, followed by a generated Insight Card.]**

**Narrator**: "In seconds, WellLoop analyzes the survey vectors. Look at this—it doesn't just say 'Team is tired.' It identifies a specific correlation: *'Context switching between 3 concurrent projects is reducing code quality by 15%.'*"

**[Visual: Mouse hovering over a 'Generate Report' button, and a PDF preview appearing.]**

**Narrator**: "And for the leadership review? One click generates an Executive PDF Report, summarizing these complex data points into actionable SWOT analysis. No more guessing games."

## 🏁 3:15 - 3:45 | Conclusion & Future
**[Visual: "What's Next: Manager Auto-Pilot" text on screen.]**

**Narrator**: "This is just the beginning. Our next phase is 'Manager Auto-Pilot'—an agent that can automatically draft calendar blocks, like 'No-Meeting Wednesdays,' to protect your team's focus time."

**[Visual: WellLoop AI Logo and GitHub Repository link.]**

**Narrator**: "Teams shouldn't have to burn out to build great things. With WellLoop AI, we're making well-being predictive, personal, and proactive. Thank you."
